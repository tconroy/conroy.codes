You are currently viewing Phenomic base theme.

For now [Phenomic does not provide a native way to extend themes](https://github.com/MoOx/phenomic/issues/508) but since it's based on
React and uses a component approach, it's pretty easy to make your own reusable collection of layouts and components.
