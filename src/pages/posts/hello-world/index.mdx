A new year, a new website!
<!--/excerpt-->

Like many software engineers, my personal site has wallowed in a perpetual 
"in development" status for years and years. 

It's not from lack of effort â€” on the contrary, I've started down this road 
so many times now I've completely lost count! Some of those attempts were 
short-lived, springing up over a long weekend as an excuse to play with some new 
tech stack, framework, or webhost. Other attempts were longer-lived, spanning many 
months and hours of meticulous planning and coding.

None of those projects ever saw the light of day.

## YASEB (or, Yet Another Software Engineering Blog)

A few months ago, I decided that at the _very least_, I need to launch my 
personal site by 2021. No exceptions. I'm not a big New Year resolutions guy, 
so this is about the closest I get to having one. Sometimes, giving yourself a 
deadline (even an entirely arbitrary one) can help light a fire under you.
At least that is what I'm banking on. ðŸ¤ž

So, why yet another software engineering blog? 

## But why is this so hard?

I'm not exactly sure why it has taken me so long to get some sort of 
online presence. For someone who literally makes websites for a living,
you'd figure that is easy-peasy, no?

### Imposter Syndrome

I think part of it is good old fashioned 
imposter syndrome. Even though I'm a senior engineer, have built apps used by 
millions of monthly users and have worked in tech for the better part of a decade, 
I _still_ often feel as if I know nothing. Like I'm one day away being discovered 
for â€” gasp â€” not actually knowing _everything single thing_ about software.
What even is the point if I can't even can't inverse a binary tree?
I might as well hang up my hat, right?

Obviously, all of that is gatekeeping nonsense. Publishing this blog is in 
part to help me to get over that feeling.

### Perfectionism
Seemingly at odds with Imposter Syndrome is being a perfectionist. At work,
I often struggle with letting a project go in a state that I don't feel satisfied
with - but at least in that context, you have hard business deadlines. Personal 
projects, not so much. I've continuously started and stopped my personal site 
so many times, I've lost track.

To counter this, I'm forcing myself to publish my site, warts and all. It is 
_not_ perfect, nor will it ever be. It will always be a work in progress.
